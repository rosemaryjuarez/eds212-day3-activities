# libraPart 1:

## Task 1:

Create an object called 'pm2_5\`'with a value of 48 (representing Particulate Matter 2.5, an indicator for air quality, in μgm3���3 (see more about PM2.5 [here](https://www3.epa.gov/region1/airquality/pm-aq-standards.html)).

Write an `if - else if - else` statement that returns \"Low to moderate risk\" if `pm2_5` (for Particulate Matter 2.5) is less than 100, \"Unhealthy for sensitive groups\" if PM 2.5 is 100 \<= pm2_5 \< 150, and \"Health risk present\" if PM 2.5 is \>= 150.

Test by changing the value of your pm2_5 object and re-running your statement to check.

```{r}
pm2_5 <- 160

if (pm2_5 < 100) {
  print('Low to moderate risk')
} else if (100 <= pm2_5 & pm2_5< 150) {
  print('Unhealthy for sensitive groups')
} else {
  print('Health risk present')
}
```

## task 2

Store the string \"blue whale\" as an object called `species`. Write an if statement that returns \"You found a whale!\" if the string \"whale\" is detected in species, otherwise return nothing. Test by changing the species string & re-running to see output.

```{r}
species = 'blue whale'

if (str_detect(species, 'blue whale')) {
  print('You found a whale!')
}
```

## task 3

Store the base price of a burrito as `base_burrito` with a value of 6.50. Store `main_ingredient` with a starting string of \"veggie.\" Write a statement that will return the price of a burrito based on what a user specifies as \"main_ingredient\" (either \"veggie\", \"chicken\" or \"steak\") given the following:

-   A veggie burrito is the cost of a base burrito

-   A chicken burrito costs 3.00 more than a base burrito

-   A steak burrito costs 3.25 more than a base burrito

```{r}
base_burrito <- 6.50

main_ingredient <- 'veggie'

switch (main_ingredient,
  'veggie' = print(base_burrito),
  'chicken' = print(base_burrito + 3.00),
  'steak' = print(base_burrito + 3.25)
) 
```

#### **Task 4**

Create a new vector called `fish` that contains the values `8, 10, 12, 23` representing counts of different fish types in a fish tank (goldfish, tetras, guppies, and mollies, respectively). Write a for loop that iterates through `fish`, and returns what proportion of total fish in the tank are that species. Assume that these counts represent all fish in the tank.

```{r}
fish <- c(goldfish = 8,
          tetras = 10,
          guppies = 12,
          mollies = 23)


for (fishies in seq_along(fish)) {
  print(fish[[fishies]]/ sum(fish))
}
```

## task 5

#### **Task 5**

There is an existing vector in R called `month.name` that contains all month names (just ry running `month.name` in the Console to check it out). **Write a for loop** that iterates over all months in `month.name` and prints \"January is month 1,\" \"February is month 2\", etc.

**Hint:** you can index values in the `month.name` vector just like you would any other vector (e.g., try running `month.name[5]`).

```{r}
for (months in seq_along(month.name)) {
  print(paste(month.name[months], 'is month', months ))
}
```
